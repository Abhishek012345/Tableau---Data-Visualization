Pie chart- part to whole analysis
1)select profit and region 
2)go to show me panel and then click on pie chart
3)adjust the pie chart to fir the entire screen(entire view)
4)drag profits onto my lable shelf,drag regions onto my lable shelf
5)i want to see % values for profits, i will put profit in my marks card
6)create a calculated field on profits by right clicking and selecting from qucik table calculation
7)select % of total from quick table calculation
8)drag the calculated proft filed onto my label shelf
9)remove the profit text field from the marks card

Heat maps -only 2 measures (we can control the size and color)
1) select profit and sub category , then go to show me panel and select heat maps
2)then if we want to see the profits for sub category over time, add date to my column shelf
3)then add sales to my color shelf
4)my objective is to control size with respect to sales and control profit with respect to color
5)darg profit field in marks card to color shelf
6)then bring sales filed onto my size shelf in marks card 
this will ensure that my sales is being controlled by size and profits are being controlled by color

just qucik relatrive comparison , you can use heat maps
size is denoting sales, color is denoting profit

Tree maps- come in handy when we want to represent alot of data points in a hierarchial fashion
2 measures (one for size and one for color)
we can contro size of rectangle and color of recgtangle with helo of 2 measures
how many rectangles will be controlled by dimensions
you can add and subtract rectangles by adding state and city
1)select profit and sub category 
2) go to show me panel and then click on tree maps
3)i am getting negative values in my dataset , so i will solve this problem by putting profit field in color shelf of my marks card
4)then i bring my sales field on to my size shelf of marks card
5)i will bring country dimension onto my label shelf of marks card
6) i will bring my sate and city onto my label shelf of marks card

we cannot have a rectangle with negative area, that is why tableau is showing 3 missing values -negative profits

Area chart - we have discrete and continuous 
when do we go for area chart , when we want a line chart as well as the break up
it is basically a combination of a line chart and satcked bar chart
total profit is sumof all parts
1) select profit and subcategory , this will not help me , whe because i need atleast one date mesaure to draw my area chart
2)drag date measure onto my column shelf
3) go to show me panel and then clik on area chart
4)drag your category dimension onto your color shelf of your marks card
5)add text to your area chart for better understanding


circle view, dot plot - alternative to bar chart
dot plot 
1) i will select profit and sub category and then go to my show me panel , selct bar graph by default
2) go to your marks card and select for circle to get your dot plot
Circle plot or circle view
1) i will selct profit and sub category and then go to my show me panel and select bar graph by default
2) go to your marks card and select shape to get your circle view or circle plot


sorting- from axis and pane
if you have multiple measures, tableau will consider the first measure to sort the values
tool bar is anyways there
1) tool bar sorting 
2) sorting from axis
3) sorting from color panel
4) sorting from field ( i can select sales here)
5) sort from your y axis
sorting can be done by second measure also 
all we have to do is selct that measure , go to my tool bar and select sort by ascending or descending 

Filtering- Dimension
1)General- manual filtering
2)Wildcard- setup string conditions (end with s paper and storage are gone)
3)Condition- based on some measure value (profit >0)
4)Top customers

Filtering -Dates
1) Years- You can filter by number of years
2) you can filter by number of quarters
3) you can filter by range of dates
4) you can filter by start date and end date
5) you can filter by refrence dates

select sub category vs profit ans then add region on column shelf
then filter based on customer names starting with A

measure filters-range of dates
