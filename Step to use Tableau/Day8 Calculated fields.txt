Arbitary formatting- manual go to quick filter and change colors
Drawback -this gets applied to all the charts wherever you apply order date 

Conditional formatting or data spotlighting
Use calculated fields 
if sum(sales) >600k say it is very good sales 
ex2: coffee chain
drag product type and product on row shelf (check how data is distributed)
then drag sales and product on column shelf
CASE [product type]

Ex3:
connected to global superstore dataset
there are different markets in global superstore, how they are faring with respect to sales, can they match the target ?whcih countries performing well or under performing
drag markets onto row shelf to understand
well establieshe markets: asia pacific , europe and usaca
emerging markets-africa and latam

ATTR is attribute function, general purpose it will return * if it has more than 1 value, it will return expression if it has 1 value or unique value
ATTR is aggregation for non numeric data or dimensions, tableau will not mix disaggregate and aggregate functions
so wrap it in your ATTR, 

ATTR Function
1)bring city and state to row shelf, observe apple valley is present in 2 states
2)change state to attribute to see the * (get me list of cities wihich are there in more than 1 state is the question)
Take attribiute onto filter shelf, and select * to get list of cities which are present in more than 1 state

calculated fields
sales across different years,all the calculations will be at level of detail
look at diff in sales,if you see a triangle , it is a quick table calculations, direction is important
by default all calcluations happen table across, you can also select table down or a comnbination
then you can also select pane across , pane down and combination
pane is nothing but my year(2015, 2016, 2017 , 2018)
we can also calculte for other measures such as % of total sales etc.
