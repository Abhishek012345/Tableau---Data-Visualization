Basic Charts
Text Tables- Put measure values in color shelf and then change the text type to square type(this will help us conver text table to highlight tabel). then create different legends for each measure and adjust the color as per preference.This feature was introduced in version 10.2

Highlight Table vs Text Table
Highlight table -you can use only 1 measure( profit)
Text Table- you can use more than 1 measure(profit, sales, number of records, profit ratio)
Whenver we want to make use of 1 measure , please use highlight table 
if there are more than 1 measure, then we can use text table
1) you plot profit against subcategory( subcategory is in row shelf and profit in column shelf)
2)By default tableau will show me a bar graph , then go to show me panel and select highlight table
3) you can add a new dimension called date to see the profit result over time

Bar charts- categorical comoparison, quick comparative analysis, most popular graph
go to mark shelf, labels , turn on labels, always show labels 
1) plot profit vs subcategory(profit will be row shelf , subcategory in column shelf)
2)tableau will autoamtically display bar graph, you can freely change the color by going to marks card
3)you can click on show mark lables to see all the values for profit
4) if you want to highlight any particular value, you can do this by right clicking on the specific bar , got to mark labels , check always show

stacked bar-if i want to understand the mode of shipment for differet subcategories , i can make use of stacked bar chart
difficult to read when margin difference is ver very less
within year i want to achieve which category is better
1) plot profit vs order date (profit will be row shelf and order date will be in column shelf)
2) i want to check for profits across different categories, simply drop category dimension onto color shelf
3)you can clikc on show mark labels to know what profit is being contributed by different categories
4)if you also want to show sales , we can drop sales on the marks card
5) then right click on sales , go to quick tabel calculation , check for % of total sum of sales
6) once you have created a calculated field(you will see a traiangle next to sales)
7 then drop this sales field onto your label shelf
8) you will see % values of sales displayed on the graph, then right click and say compute using down, this will total all your percentage values to 100
9)right click on the bar graph , select fields go to percentages then select for how many ever datapoints you want to include4

Side by side chart
1)plot profit vs category ,the you also bring date 
2) then you go to show me panel and then  you click on side by side chart, tableau will display ut automatically

4)you can rearrange your fields like date should brought before you category
5) you can simply add text lables to understand the profits for different categories over time 
Date hierarchies are automatically created by Tbaleau


Line Graphs-Discrete line chart , Continuous line chart
difference between discrete line chart and continuous line chart is color (discrete is blue in color , continuous is green in color)
by default it is discrete line chart, Year is blue in color -discrete, year is green in color -continuous
dicrete chart- will give consolidated view, line chart will give a more detailed view
